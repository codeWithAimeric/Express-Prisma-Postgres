# üõ†Ô∏è Node.js Express Project with Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Docker

Welcome to my **Node.js** project where I'm practicing the use of **Express.js** with **Prisma** as the ORM, **PostgreSQL** as the database, all containerized using **Docker**. This repository serves as a demonstration of setting up a modern, efficient, and scalable web application stack.
